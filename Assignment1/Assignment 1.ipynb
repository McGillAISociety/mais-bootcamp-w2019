If we simply did regression on this data, the labels would imply some sort of ordering and distance between the classes (imagine we were classing colors instead, there is no notion of distance or order i.e. 8 is not \"more\" of a digit than 7). We can fix this issue by one-hot encoding our labels. So, instead of each label being a simple digit, each label is a vector of 10 entries. 9 of those entries are zero, and only 1 entry is equal to one, corresponding to the index of the digit. This way, the distance between the labels are the same."
