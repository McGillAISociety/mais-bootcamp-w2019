# Assigment 2

This is your second assignment! Much like your first assignment, please go through the python notebook labelled `assignment2.ipynb` and fill out the code. Remember - this assignment is for your own learning experience, try and attempt it yourself before asking/looking for help! (Google and the PyTorch docs are your friend)

Before starting, make sure you have everything in the installed - PyTorch, Numpy and Matplotlib. (ESPECIALLY PyTorch - you won't need the GPU version for this assignment! https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

## Submission
To submit this assignment, as per assignment 1, please export `assignment2.ipynb` into `assignment2.py`. Afterwards, please make a pull request to the master branch of the original repository. Comments will be left in the `assignment2.py` file. PLEASE DO NOT MERGE THE PULL REQUEST!
