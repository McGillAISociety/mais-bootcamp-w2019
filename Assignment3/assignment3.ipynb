    "Using this knowledge, you will create a neural network in PyTorch for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. PyTorch uses the $DataLoader$ class for you to load data into batches to feed to your learning algorithms - we highly suggest you familiarze yourself with this as well as the Dataset API here: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html. Fill in the below code to instantiate 3 DataLoaders for your training, validation and test sets. We would prefer that you NOT use the `torchvision.transform` API - we want you to get some practice in data preprocessing! Here are the transformations we want you to perform:\n",
    "1. Split the `val_and_test_set` into two separate datasets (each with 5000 elements)\n",
    "2. Convert all the `np.array` elements into `torch.tensor` elements.\n",
    "3. All values will be pixel values in our images are in the range of [0, 256]. Normalize this so that each pixel is in the range [0, 1].\n",
    "3. Flatten all images. All your images will be of shape (32, 32, 3), we need them as flat (32 * 32 * 3) size tensors as input to our neural network.\n",
    "4. Load everything into a DataLoader. (check how this works in the PyTorch docs!) \n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to have the options `shuffle=True` (so that your dataset is shuffled so that samples from the dataset are not correlated) and also `batch_size=32` or larger. This is a standard minibatch size. If you're curious about what batch size does (and are somewhat familiar with statistics), here's a great answer https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/316464/how-does-batch-size-affect-convergence-of-sgd-and-why."
