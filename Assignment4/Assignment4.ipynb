However, before we dive into that, this assignment will be focused on ensuring you understand all the core concepts that have been covered so far.

Typically we will use least squares method which consists of minimizing the sum of squares of the vertical distance between each point and the model line. \n",

    "#  Overfitting\n",
    "Overfitting in polynomial regression can occur when our polynomial modeled curve is of a too-high degree. It seems to fit our training data very well, however, the actual relationship between our data is more similar to a lower degree polynomial and thus when we apply our model to test data, the accuracy is low.\n",

    "Underfitting occurs when our polynomialmodel is of too low a degree to accurately reflect the relationship between our data. It may appear to fit the training data, however, it performs poorly on the test data because it is not representative of the actual relationship between the variables. For example, our mode polynomial curve might be a degree 2, when the actual data is more similar to a degree 4. "

    "Support Vector Machine is a supervised ml algorithm which is mostly used for classification problems. Support vectors represent the coordinates of our data points. The goal of the algorithm is to select the ebst hyperplane to segregate the data properly. The margin represents the distance between nearest data points in different partitions and the goal is to maximize the margin while still maintaining the right seperations. In order to get the best classification partitions possible, we want to penalize the model for each mistake or mismatch. For this, we introduce slack variables. They represent the deviation of the data from the margin and allow us to use a soft margin, meaning that we can relax the boundaries. Kernel functions allow us to computer a sort of dot product between vecotrs in arbitrary dimension. It can be thought of as the \"similarity\" between the vectors which helps us classify them. \n",
