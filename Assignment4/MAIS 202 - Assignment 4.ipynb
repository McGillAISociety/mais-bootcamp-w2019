    "Congratulations, you have reached the midpoint of the course! The rest of the course will be focused on more advanced state of the art machine learning techniques. However, before we dive into that, this assignment will be focused on ensuring you understand all the core concepts that have been covered so far. Keep in mind, these are questions that can be asked during machine learning internship interviews, so do make sure you understand them if you want to dive into this industry!"

    "Linear Regression is a prediction Y (What to predict) of (Values/data) X using a single straight line of the form (y = ax + b). Polynomial Regression is a prediction using the a k-order derivate of a polynimal to allow a line to curve to best fit X to predict Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting is the when the model has overtrained (gotten too used to the data) and cannot make accurate predictions outside of the training data.\n",
    "Underfitting is when the model after being trained cannot predict accurately the data or just does not find a trend/line that best fits X.\n"

    "Logistic Regression is a classfication model that by predicting Y by taking X all that have binary labels (either 0 or 1) and passing them through a polynomial function (for example y = ax + b) and then passing it through a sigmoid function so that the prediction will either come out between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, Linear Support Vector Machine is classification model to find a line such that the support vectors (closest points to the line) create the biggest margin between the classes. To allow us to separate data that is merged together, slack variables are used to calculate the error when a point/value is on the incorrect side where the best line is the one with the least amount of error. The Linear Support Vector Machine uses a linear line (y = ax + b) function to create the line. Other kernels would create other forms of lines or shapes to separate the points/data."

    "A supervised learning algorithm is an algorithm that has X input such that there is an associated output Y where it can be compared to the Y prediction. Essentially, the prediction of the model can have a fixed size. On the other hand, an unsupervised learning algorithm has X input, but not Y output, where the output is not fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-NN is a supervised learning algorithm because regardless of label it will classify them without knowledge of them. The lazy in K-NN means that there is no training-time because all of the training data will stay during the testing/prediction phase as well. Instead, K-NN uses a similarity function/metric that will compare the input or point that you want to predict to the closest points where the points to compare are numbered at K. Based on the similarity function/metric and the labels of its neighbours it will then return the label that occurs the most in the neighbours. K-NN can be used to classify a credits system or to predict who you will vote for. K-NN in essence compares you to your neighbours when looking to make a prediction about you, which makes sense because usually your neighbours resemble you, unless you are an outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm: \n",
    "C = inputs / points to predict\n",
    "K = number of neighbours to check\n",
    "For each point:\n",
    "    Find the K most closest points by distance (neighbours)\n",
    "    Identify the labels/class of each point\n",
    "    Sum the counts of each class\n",
    "    Set the class/label of the point\n",
    "Return [(neighbours, class)]\n"
