However, before we dive into that, this assignment will be focused on ensuring you understand all the core concepts that have been covered so far. Keep in mind, these are questions that can be asked during machine learning internship interviews, so do make sure you understand them if you want to dive into this industry!"

    "Linear regression is a regression of the form y = theta 1 x^1 +theta2 x^0+ epsilon. It can be used when the data we are trying to fit has a linear shape, i.e. a line, but it cannot fit a model in the form of a polynomial.\n",
    "# Polynomial Regression\n",
    "This is what the regression that allows the model to fit more complex data, based on the same initial set of data. By calling SKLearn Polynomial Features, we will be transforming the data in the following way. Assume we have 1D data of two inputs. [a,b], it will be transformed to [1,a^2,b^2,ab]. And we can fit our coefficients on those 4 inputs instead if 2. Assuming degree 2. That is.\n",

    "Underfitting means your model is not complex enough to capture completely your data. I.e. fitting a line through a (x^2) shape for instance.\n",

    "This means your model is way too complex, to capture what happened in the data. I.e. you are also fitting the noise of that data. I.e. Fitting a (x^2) with a polynomial of degree 10. It is akin to have memorized the data completely."
