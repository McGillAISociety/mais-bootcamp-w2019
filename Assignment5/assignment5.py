# Assignment 5

### Intro
In this assignment, you will design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based algorithm that can automatically identify hand-written digits.

We will be using the Keras API to design our CNN. Keras is a high-level library that builds on top of lower-level libraries like Tensorflow and Theano. In other words, Keras can be thought of as a front-end API which uses a backend engine for its computations. For example, we can use Keras with a Tensorflow or Theano backend. Since Keras does not yet support PyTorch, we will be using the Tensorflow backend (Theano is not widely used anymore). Follow the README to install both Tensorflow and Keras.

The nice thing about APIs like Keras is that we can create models quickly without having to worry about the underlying implementation. However, for highly customzed algorithms it is usually necessary to work with the lower-level libraries like PyTorch or Tensorflow.

You should definitely read this before attempting this assignment: https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/

Essentially Keras has two ways of defining a model: Sequentially or Functionally. We use the sequential approach in this assignment but you are more than welcome to try the functional approach as this is more commonly used.

### Background
The dataset we will use is a variant of the orignal MNIST handwritten digit dataset. In this variant, each image (input) contains two or three digits from the original MNIST dataset randomly scaled to 40/60/80/100/120 percent of the original digit size and spliced together at different angles.

For each image in the modified dataset, the correct label corresponds to the digit with the maximum area. More precisely, this area refers to area of the rectangle which encompasses the digit.

We will use 39999 images for training and 10000 images for testing.

### Your task
Your task for this assignment is to improve the base model and achieve an accuracy of 95% or above on the test set. You will do this by making the model more complex by doing the following:
1. Changing the architecture of the model by adding Conv2d, Dense(feed-forward), Pooling, [Dropout](https://medium.com/@amarbudhiraja/https-medium-com-amarbudhiraja-learning-less-to-learn-better-dropout-in-deep-machine-learning-74334da4bfc5), and any other layers that make sense.
2. Playing around the parameters of the layers. Do some quick research to see what kind of pooling, for example, could be effective in this task and experiment!
3. Modify the preprocess function if you think you can do better

### Note:
This assignment may take a while to complete (mostly due to training time). If you find that it is taking too long, reduce the batch size (to some lower power of 2) and reduce the number of epochs from 10 to a lower number. Whatever accuracy you end up with does not matter as long as we see that you have tried you complete this assignment :)
